# Spaceship Titanic - Classification Project

This project is part of the Kaggle competition **Spaceship Titanic**.  
We approach the problem with a professional, real-world machine learning pipeline.

## Problem Definition

The goal is to predict whether a passenger was transported to another dimension during the Spaceship Titanic incident.  
This is a **binary classification problem** where the target variable is `Transported` (True or False).

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes two files:

| File        | Description                                              |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `train.csv` | Contains passenger data with labels (`Transported`)      |
| `test.csv`  | Contains passenger data without labels (for predictions) |
